Can any useful information about the orignial picture be seen in the encrypted files?
	For the CBC encrypted files, when they are viewed in an image viewer, the picture seems to just be random noise. 
	As for the ECB encrypted files, when these files are viewed in an image viewer, it's very easy to see basic shapes. "pic_original.bmp" has very distinct shapes, an oval and a square. In the EBC encrypted "pic_original", although the colors are distorted, the basic outlines and the fact that the shapes are solidly colored in can very easily be seen
